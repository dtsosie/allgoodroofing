        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
  <blockquote>    
  <p>  All Good Roofing and Additions is a company that is professional and very reliable. We had them add a very large patio cover to our house. Mark personally explained to us how it could be attached to our existing roof line not only to look like it was a part of the original building but also in a way to assure us that we would have no leaks in the future. Other contractors said it couldn't be done.</p>
  <p>  The completed product was just what we wanted and it matches the house as if it was built with the new construction. He was prompt with his estimate and all the employees were very professional and their ability to complete the job was a joy to watch. They were willing to answer all our questions as the job was being done. Words can't explain how pleased we are with Mark and his employees. Every time we step out our back door we are so thankful that we found All Good Roofing and Additions and will definitely call them in the future for any of our roofing and/or addition needs.</p>

  <p>All Good Roofing provided professional and timely services. The covered wooden patio that was built looks like part of my original home. The craftsmanship and quality is outstanding not mention the expediency.</p>

  <p> All Good Additions is an excellent company. Mark came out to our residence and went over our needs for a patio cover twice prior to us accepting his quote. The crew worked diligently and always advised us, when they left the property to grab a bite to eat. The contract electricians were prompt and professional. The patio cover withstood the test of rain the past two weekends. We love our new patio cover with two ceiling fans and flood lights. Everyone, who has come over to see it, are impressed, too. We often eat our meals outside now and our grandchildren love to play there, too. We feel this addition has added value to our home. Thank you for the awesome job. Mark, we've recommended All Good Roofing to our neighbors, who are having some rather peculiar leaks. Also, we may be in touch with you soon for some concrete work we will need to have done.</p>

  <p>I am a recent customer of All Good Roofing and Additions.  You just replaced my shingle and metal roofs on my house.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of a situation that occurred at my house during the replacement of the roofs.  Oscar Mejia came to my house to finish the metal roof replacement on my back porch.  At about 9:00 a.m. he knocked on my door but by the time I answered he had gone back to working.</p>
  <p>When I came out back I asked him if he needed something and he said, "Yes, I need to give you this; I found it by your grill".  Oscar then handed me $140 in cash.  It seems the night before when I was grilling some steaks, I inadvertently dropped the cash out of my pocket.</p>
  <p>The good deed speaks volumes about the character of employee you have in Oscar Mejia.  I am quite sure had I hired many other roofing companies the outcome would not have been the same.  In addition to that situation, Oscar was extremely professional the entire time and every stayed late to clean up in the dark!</p>
  <p>On another note, I also wanted to comment on Jim Thomas' professionalism as well.  Jim was very thorough, followed up about the bid (but was not overly aggressive).  This ended up winning my business as most companies either bothered me calling so much or followed up so late that you were already re-roofing my roof.</p>
  <p>Jim also kept me up to speed constantly when there was that unexpected delay with the special green metal roof materials.</p>
  <p>All in all, it was a great experience and the work was solid.  I would and will use All Good again.</p>
  <p>I just wanted to make sure you were aware of the quality of the folks working for you.</p>
  <p>Thanks again.</p>
